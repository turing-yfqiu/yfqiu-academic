I pursue my doctoral studies at University of Edinburgh and University of Cambridge, advised by Shay Cohen and Anna Korhonen in the ELLIS PhD & PostDoc program.

Prior to starting my PhD, I spent time at Baidu NLP as an Research Intern where I worked on Open-domain Question Answering and Dense Retrieval. During my MSc, I worked on text summarization and structured prediction with Shay Cohen at University of Edinburgh.
